		<div class="body">The red bean milk pudding was one of my favorite desserts to eat as a child. During my elementary school years, my grandparents used to take me to a local dessert spot and buy me a red bean milk pudding almost every Friday afterschool. What makes it special is that it has a layer of film formed by the milk on top. This is a simple recipe that is also very delicious.</div>
