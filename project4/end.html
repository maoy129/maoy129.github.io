	<p>I shouldn't be mad at you for this. I know this exam is very important. I'm just a little bit upset, because it's been a month since the last time we met and I miss you a lot. We can meet up a different time then. I love you. Good luck with your exam :)</p>

	<p>I miss you too :( It's still my fault for not planning out the exam. I booked a nice restaraunt for next friday at 6pm. I promise I'll be there on time! Here's the location.</p>
